Code for (Celery) worker used in our "Stream service".
It reuses [packit-service's worker](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/tree/main/packit_service/worker)
code and [implements new jobs as new handlers](https://github.com/packit/research/tree/main/split-the-stream#2-separate-workers).

## Workflow

The service is similar to [Packit service](https://github.com/packit/packit-service),
but is expected to eventually follow [this workflow](https://github.com/packit/research/tree/main/split-the-stream#what-does-the-source-git-workflow-mean):

##### Must have:

- [x] If a user creates a merge-request on the source-git repository:
  - [x] Create a matching merge-request to the dist-git repository.
  - [x] Sync the CI results from the dist-git merge-request to the source-git merge-request.
- [x] If the dist-git is updated, update the source-git repository by opening a PR.
- [ ] User is able to convert source-git change to the dist-git change locally via CLI.

##### Should have:

- [x] If the source-git merge-request is updated, update the dist-git merge-request.
- [x] If the source-git merge-request is closed, close the dist-git merge-request.

##### Could have:

- [ ] User is able to re-trigger the dist-git CI from the source-git merge-request.
- [ ] User is able to re-create the dist-git MR from the source-git merge-request.

## Running it locally

[Similar to packit-service](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-packit-service-locally)
we have a [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) for fast prototyping.

It expects, that you have:

- [.env.fedora-source-git](.env.fedora-source-git) or [env.stream](.env.stream)
  copied or symlinked (`ln -s .env.fedora-source-git .env`) to `.env`.
- `secrets/fedora-source-git/dev/` or `secrets/stream/dev/` populated (linked)
  with secrets mostly taken from our internal repo.
  "Mostly", because you should use your credential where possible.
- `../ogr/`, `../packit/` and `../packit-service/` dirs with the respected repos cloned.
  Those are mounted into the container, so you don't have to
  rebuild the image each time you change anything in them.

Follow the [packit-service's guide](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-packit-service-locally)
for the other settings. Once you have it running (and see no errors), you can test (uses [HTTPie](https://httpie.io)) the webhook with:

    cat tests/data/webhooks/gitlab/mr_event.json | http --verify=no https://service.localhost:8443/api/webhooks/gitlab

## How to deploy

To deploy the service into Openshift cluster,
clone the [deployment repo](https://github.com/packit/deployment) and:

1. [create the variable files](https://github.com/packit/deployment/tree/main/vars) in [vars/stream/](https://github.com/packit/deployment/tree/main/vars/stream)
2. link secrets into [secrets](https://github.com/packit/deployment/tree/main/secrets) / stream/{prod|stg}
3. `SERVICE={fedora-source-git|stream} DEPLOYMENT={deployment} make deploy`

## Image

[The image](files/Containerfile) is currently based on the
[packit-worker image](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/blob/main/files/docker/Dockerfile.worker)
but that might change in the future to decouple those.

For running locally with docker-compose, build it with `docker-compose build`.

For deploying in cluster, the image is
[built and pushed](.github/workflows/rebuild-and-push-images.yml)
to [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/packit/hardly) whenever you push to `main`.
Or you can rebuild manually in
[Actions](https://github.com/packit/hardly/actions/workflows/rebuild-and-push-images.yml).

## Actual deployments

- [Fedora](https://github.com/packit/deployment/blob/main/docs/fedora-source-git.md)
- [CentOS Stream](https://github.com/packit/deployment/blob/main/docs/centos-stream-source-git.md)

## Tests

Locally: `make test-image` && `make check-in-container`

CI: [Zuul](.zuul.yaml)
